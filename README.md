## How to create a timeline

Open the web page.

Add a few events with the form - no coding needed.

See your timeline generated on the page.

Take a screenshot of the results. If you'd have to scroll, use your browser's export functionality to save the whole page.

Based on this [CSS Timeline](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp) tutorial.
